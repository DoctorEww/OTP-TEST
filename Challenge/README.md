 Preface:
 
You are an elite hacker and you just got into a database that has encrypted files and their unencrypted counterparts (these files can be found the database tab). You look through the files and see a file called goal.encrypted however you can't find the unencrypted version of this file and you know some crime lords that are willing to pay top dollar for the contents of goal.

The goal is to decrypt a file called goal.encrypted

There are some clues:
1) Every file is encrypted and decrypted with otptest.py found in the root directory.
2) There is no seed (leave blank).
3) The passwords used to encrypt each file is the same.
4) The passwords are less than or equal to 7 characters.
5) If you want more files for analysis I can make more.

The people that have completed the challenge:
no one yet :(


Reason I am doing this:
1) I want to learn.
2) Can this be brute forced?
3) If someone has all the parts can they reverse engineer it?
4) Is this a legit method of encryption ?
5) Can the code become more efficient?
6) What are the flaws with this?

Please leave a comment or email me at admin@drewgriess.com 
Oh and if you can actually get the original contents of the file tell me how you did it and give me proof and will add you to this read me with a link to your site/github/whatever
